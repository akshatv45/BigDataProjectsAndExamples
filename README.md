# BigDataProjectsAndExamples

In this repository I will update all the scala examples and BigData Technologies that I work upon in due course of time. I have uploaded the basic scala coding modules as of now in the main branch itself. Any practitioners are welcome to fork on this. Happy Learning! 


If you want to get on and ahead with Distributed Computing then Scala is going to be your tool to get on with this technology.
